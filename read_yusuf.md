# Project Proposal: Relationship between Oscar-Winner Films Release Year and Netflix Availability

## Abstract:

This project proposal aims to investigate the relationship between the release year of films  won for the Oscars and the year they are made available on Netflix. Through empirical analysis, we seek to uncover patterns and trends that may exist between these two variables. Understanding such relationships could offer insights into Netflix's content acquisition strategies, audience preferences, and the impact of prestigious awards on streaming platforms.

## Introduction:

In recent years, streaming platforms like Netflix have revolutionized the way we consume entertainment, offering a vast array of films and television shows at our fingertips. Concurrently, the Academy Awards (Oscars) continue to serve as a hallmark of cinematic excellence, with nominated and winning films often experiencing increased visibility and prestige. As Netflix expands its catalog of content, questions arise regarding the timing and selection process for acquiring award-winning films.

This project seeks to explore the temporal dynamics between the release years of Oscar-nominated or winning films and their availability on Netflix. By examining data spanning multiple years and categories, we aim to discern whether there is a discernible pattern or correlation between these two variables. Such insights could shed light on Netflix's content acquisition strategies, the influence of awards on streaming platform decisions, and potential shifts in audience viewing habits.

## Objective:

The primary objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the release year of films recognized by the Oscars and the year they are made accessible on Netflix. Specifically, our objectives include:

1. Collecting a comprehensive dataset comprising Oscar-nominated or winning films and their respective release years.
2. Compiling data on the availability of these films on Netflix, including the year of their addition to the platform.
3. Analyzing the temporal relationship between the release years of Oscar-recognized films and their availability on Netflix.
4. Identifying any trends, patterns, or correlations that may exist between these variables.
5. Drawing conclusions regarding Netflix's content acquisition strategies, audience preferences, and the influence of prestigious awards on streaming platform decisions.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to contribute valuable insights to both the academic discourse on film distribution and the industry practices of streaming platforms like Netflix.
